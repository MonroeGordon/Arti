# Python
Python repository
This repository contains projects I am developing in Python. I am currently working on creating the AI for a tic-tac-toe game. The repository contains the source files for the tic-tac-toe GUI and the AI (named Arti, still in development), as well as convenience functions for graphing any math functions, which is used for testing the outputs of functions found in the neuralmath source file.
